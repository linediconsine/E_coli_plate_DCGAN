# A Pytorch DCGAN implementation 
## Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network
Playing with DCGAN and Bio images

The goal of this code is learning to play dataset creation and hyperparameters thought a DCGAN model.

This code is based on:

- [The original DCGAN paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf),

- [the `networks.py` file in CycleGAN Github repository](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/models/networks.py)

- Udacity deep learning nano degree.

The goal is render an image of E.Coli plate as:

<img src='https://github.com/linediconsine/ecoli_plate/blob/main/few/few/3.jpg?raw=1' width=30% />

This code is public on [github](https://github.com/linediconsine/ecoli_plate)
